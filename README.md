Tokamak
==
Tokamak is a very simple web api for a Fusion Reactor server. It uses Fusion Reactor's FRAPI to get server metrics, and returns them as an XML response

The name Tokamak comes from the name - in nuclear physics - of a type of Fusion Reactor machine. It seemed somehow appropriate! http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokamak
